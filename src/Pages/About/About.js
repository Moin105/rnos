          The Rent and Offer is leveling up the consumer-to-consumer industry. We created The Rent and Offer to allow individuals to save and earn money. Why buy expensive items youâ€™ll rarely use when you can Rent items in your community for low prices instead? As a lender you will earn money for items you already have and on the schedule you want. You can also rent out space for unique and private experiences.

           <p>Sitting in a neighborhood pool one day, cofounders and brothers Ryan & Kevin Reese thought it would be nice to have more seclusion for their families. They realized the sharing marketplace did not have an all-inclusive option for all items or experiences. From this, The BorrowVerse was born.
</p>
           <p>Our vision is to create the top sharing marketplace for all items and experiences. </p>
